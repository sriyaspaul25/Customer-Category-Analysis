# Customer-Category-Analysis
To categorize the different types of customers that visits a retail store. To draw insights on which customers are most valuable to the retail store so that customer satisfaction remains the main priority for the retail store. 
We are going to use the RFM Modelling to categorize our Customer base and predict our Customer value for the retail store by the help of KMeans Clustering and finally for validation we will calculate the silhouette score for the compactness of the clusters formed and how the objects are well matching to its very own clusters.
